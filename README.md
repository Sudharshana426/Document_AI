# Document_AI
AI-Driven Document Chatbot for Sales Data Automation
Developed an AI-powered chatbot leveraging NLP and embedding-based models to analyze and extract insights from 2,677+ company documents, including invoices, purchase orders, inventory reports, and shipping orders. Utilized Pinecone for vector similarity, HuggingFace for embeddings, and LangChain for contextual query answering, enabling automated data extraction, rapid document processing, error reduction, and easy access to key insights.

# Financial Document Classification and Business Intelligence

## **Overview**
This project is developed as part of the Appian AI Application Challenge. It focuses on automating the classification and processing of unstructured financial documents, such as:

- Applications for bank accounts (e.g., credit card, savings account)
- Identity documents (e.g., driverâ€™s licenses, passports)
- Supporting financial documents (e.g., income statements, tax returns)
- Receipts

Additionally, the project provides **business intelligence (BI) insights**, offering actionable trends and operational efficiencies derived from document data.

## **Features**

1. **Document Classification**
   - Automatically categorizes financial documents based on content.
   - Hierarchical classification:
     - **Person Association:** Associates documents with individuals using metadata (e.g., names, government IDs).
     - **Document Type Identification:** Groups documents of the same type together (e.g., applications, receipts).

2. **Business Intelligence (BI) Insights**
   - Extracts trends from document submissions.
   - Provides operational analytics, such as:
     - Most frequent document types.
     - Processing time insights.
     - Error detection and categorization.

3. **Interactive UI**
   - Built with **Streamlit** for real-time interaction:
     - Upload financial documents.
     - View classification results instantly.
     - Analyze BI visualizations and summaries.
